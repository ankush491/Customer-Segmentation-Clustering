# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering

Project Overview:
The Customer-Segmentation-Clustering project aims to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their behavior, demographics, and purchasing patterns using clustering techniques. Understanding these segments allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer service, and optimize product offerings to meet the specific needs of different customer groups. By applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, this project seeks to uncover hidden patterns within customer data, offering insights that drive strategic business decisions.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust clustering model that accurately segments customers into meaningful groups. This involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of various clustering algorithms. The project also includes evaluating the performance of these models using metrics like silhouette score and inertia to determine the optimal number of clusters. The ultimate goal is to create well-defined customer segments that businesses can use to enhance their marketing and sales efforts.

Technologies Used
This project utilizes a variety of technologies and tools to conduct the clustering analysis. The key technologies include:

Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and implementation of clustering algorithms.

Pandas and NumPy: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and numerical computations.

Scikit-learn: For applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing clusters and understanding the distribution of data.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding, data exploration, and documentation of the clustering process.

Getting Started:
To get started with the Customer-Segmentation-Clustering project, clone the repository to your local environment using git clone <repository_url>. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks that guide you through each step of the process, from data loading and preprocessing to clustering and evaluation. For questions or contributions, please refer to the project's issue tracker or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome to further improve the accuracy and applicability of the clustering models.
